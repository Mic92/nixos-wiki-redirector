# Redirects the old NixOS wiki to the new URL

This web browser extension redirects all nixos.wiki links to wiki.nixos.org.
* 12 lines of code, will not eat your homework.

TODO: to make it easy to install these types of extensions, they need to be signed and uploaded to addons.mozilla.org.
I didn't want to go through the whole process, but if someone has the time for that, please contact me.
